Welcome! I'm Dmitry. I'm pursuing an MBA and MS of Data Science at Indiana University. My planned graudation date is May, 2025. 

This is a place where I'm making my projects available. Right now, I'm building on my energy experience and making visualizations on temperature, power plants, and energy assets.
